# Dice Probability Calculator

This is the source for my dice probability calculator 
at [https://rollprobability.com](https://rollprobability.com).
It takes the user through choosing dice to roll and calculating the
probability of different types or rolls for multiple dice. 
I output a nice colorful (and printable) graph of the probability.

## Technologies

It's built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
for styling. I used [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for the graph.
